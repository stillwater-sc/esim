In 7nm CMOS technology, typical operator energies (in picojoules):

Integer Addition: 0.1 - 0.3 pJ
Integer Multiplication: 1.0 - 2.5 pJ
Floating-Point Addition: 0.5 - 1.2 pJ
Floating-Point Multiplication: 2.0 - 4.0 pJ
Floating-Point Division: 4 - 7 pJ
Bitwise AND/OR: 0.05 - 0.2 pJ
Shift Operations: 0.2 - 0.5 pJ

CPU Register Read for 7nm

Energy: Approximately 0.1 to 0.3 picojoules (pJ)
Very low energy consumption due to minimal capacitive switching
Typically involves small, tightly-coupled storage elements


L1 Cache Read:


Energy: Around 1.0 to 2.5 picojoules (pJ)
Higher energy compared to register read due to:

Larger array size
More complex sense amplifiers
Longer bit lines
Additional peripheral circuitry




Instruction Fetch, Decode, and Dispatch:


Total Energy: Approximately 5 to 10 picojoules (pJ)
Breakdown:

Fetch: 2-4 pJ
Decode: 1-3 pJ
Dispatch: 1-3 pJ


Energy varies based on instruction complexity
More complex instructions (e.g., vector or SIMD) consume more energy



In a 7nm process node for a typical CPU, an L2 cache read energy is approximately 6 to 12 picojoules (pJ).
The specific factors influencing L2 read energy include:

Cache array size (typically 256KB to 1MB per core)
Dynamic and static power characteristics of 7nm FinFET transistors
Bit line length and capacitance
Sense amplifier design
Peripheral circuitry complexity

The higher energy compared to L1 cache reads reflects:

Larger physical array size
Longer interconnect distances
More complex peripheral circuits
Additional tag and data matching logic

The lower end of the range (6-8 pJ) represents more power-optimized designs, while the higher end (10-12 pJ) is typical for high-performance implementations prioritizing speed over energy efficiency.
