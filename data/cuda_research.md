# CUDA design

## Warp size

NVIDIA CUDA warps are groups of 32 threads that are executed together on a single Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). This design choice is a carefully considered balance between efficiency and flexibility, influenced by several factors:

**Efficiency:**

* **SIMT Execution:** Warps are executed in Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) fashion, meaning that all 32 threads within a warp execute the same instruction simultaneously. This allows for efficient instruction-level parallelism and reduces instruction fetch and decode overhead.
* **Pipeline Optimization:** A warp size of 32 threads is well-suited to fill the deep pipelines of modern GPUs. This helps to hide latency and maximize utilization of the GPU's computational resources.
* **Memory Access Coalescing:** Warps can access memory in a coalesced manner, which improves memory bandwidth utilization and reduces memory access latency. This is particularly important for global memory accesses.

**Flexibility:**

* **Thread Divergence:** While warps execute in SIMT fashion, they can handle thread divergence, where threads within a warp take different execution paths. The hardware can selectively mask inactive threads, allowing active threads to continue execution. However, thread divergence can significantly impact performance, so it's important to minimize it in your CUDA code.
* **Warp Scheduling:** The GPU scheduler can efficiently manage and schedule warps, even when there are different execution patterns within a warp. This allows for dynamic adaptation to changing workload characteristics.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Historical Context:** The warp size of 32 threads has been a consistent design choice across generations of NVIDIA GPUs. This provides a stable foundation for developers to write efficient CUDA code.
* **Hardware Limitations:** While there's potential for larger warp sizes, there are hardware constraints such as register file size and instruction cache capacity that limit the practical maximum warp size.

In conclusion, the warp size of 32 threads is a well-established design choice that balances efficiency and flexibility in NVIDIA CUDA. It enables efficient SIMT execution, pipeline optimization, and memory access coalescing, while also providing flexibility to handle thread divergence and dynamic workload characteristics.

## Threads per block trade-offs

The number of threads per block in a CUDA kernel dispatch call is a crucial parameter that significantly impacts performance. The optimal choice depends on several factors, including the specific kernel's workload, hardware capabilities, and memory access patterns.

Here are some key considerations and guidelines for selecting the threads per block parameter:

**1. Workload Characteristics:**

* **Kernel Complexity:** For simple kernels with minimal thread divergence, larger block sizes can be beneficial to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
* **Memory Access Patterns:** If the kernel involves frequent global memory accesses, smaller block sizes can help improve memory coalescing and reduce memory access latency.
* **Thread Divergence:** For kernels with significant thread divergence, smaller block sizes can help mitigate performance degradation.

**2. Hardware Capabilities:**

* **SM Count and Warp Size:** The number of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and the warp size (typically 32 threads) influence the maximum number of threads that can be executed concurrently.
* **Shared Memory:** The amount of shared memory per SM can limit the number of threads per block, especially for kernels that heavily utilize shared memory.

**3. Performance Tuning:**

* **Experimentation:** The best way to determine the optimal threads per block value is through experimentation and profiling.
* **Profiling Tools:** NVIDIA provides profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems and NVIDIA Nsight Compute that can help you analyze kernel performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
* **Grid Size:** The grid size, which determines the total number of blocks, should be chosen to fully utilize the available GPU resources.

**General Guidelines:**

* **Start with a Reasonable Value:** A common starting point is a block size of 256 or 512 threads.
* **Adjust Based on Profiling:** Use profiling tools to measure performance and identify bottlenecks.
* **Consider Memory Access Patterns:** If memory access patterns are a significant performance bottleneck, consider smaller block sizes to improve memory coalescing.
* **Balance Thread Divergence and Parallelism:** For kernels with significant thread divergence, smaller block sizes can help mitigate performance degradation. However, excessively small block sizes can reduce instruction-level parallelism.

**Example:**

```c++
// Kernel function
__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int size) {
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    // Kernel code
}

// Kernel launch
int threadsPerBlock = 256;
int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
myKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(data, size);
```

Remember that the optimal threads per block value can vary depending on the specific kernel and hardware configuration. It's essential to experiment and profile to find the best settings for your particular use case.
