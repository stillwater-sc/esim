In 14nm CMOS technology, typical operator energies (in picojoules) are:

Integer Addition: 0.2 - 0.5 pJ
Integer Multiplication: 1.5 - 3.0 pJ
Floating-Point Addition: 0.7 - 1.5 pJ
Floating-Point Multiplication: 2.5 - 4.5 pJ
Floating-Point Division: 5 - 8 pJ
Bitwise AND/OR: 0.1 - 0.3 pJ
Shift Operations: 0.3 - 0.6 pJ

For a typical 14nm CMOS CPU:
Instruction Fetch:
 5-10 pJ per instruction
Depends on cache hierarchy, fetch width

Instruction Decode:
 2-5 pJ per instruction
Complexity varies with instruction set architecture

Instruction Dispatch:
 3-7 pJ per instruction
Influenced by out-of-order execution complexity

Total energy for these stages: ~10-20 pJ per instruction, with significant variation based on specific microarchitectural design.

For a typical 14nm CMOS register file:

Read energy: 0.2-0.4 pJ per bit
Influenced by register size, typically 32-128 bits per register
Specific design can reduce energy to ~0.1 pJ per bit with advanced techniques

Write energy: 0.3-0.6 pJ per bit
Slightly higher than read energy due to additional charging/state-setting requirements
Dependent on write port design, bitline capacitance, and voltage

For a typical 14nm CMOS L1 cache
Read energy: 1-3 pJ per bit
Write energy: 2-4 pJ per bit.
Energy varies with:
  Cache size (typically 32-64 KB)
  Associativity
  Access transistor design
  Bitline and wordline capacitances

32byte cacheline read  = 32*8*[1,1.5,2,3pJ] = 256, 384, 512, 768pJ
32byte cacheline write = 32*8*[2,3,4pJ] = 512, 768, 1024pJ

For a DDR5 cacheline read in a 14nm CMOS system:

Typical cacheline size: 64 bytes (512 bits)
Energy per DDR5 read: Approximately 10-20 picojoules (pJ) per bit
Total cacheline read energy: ~5-10 nanojoules (nJ)

For a DDR5 cacheline write in a 14nm CMOS system:

Typical cacheline size: 64 bytes (512 bits)
Energy per DDR5 write: Approximately 15-25 picojoules (pJ) per bit
Total cacheline write energy: ~8-13 nanojoules (nJ)

The write energy is slightly higher than read energy due to:
 Additional signal transitions
 Power required to change memory state
 Driving write circuitry
 Increased signal conditioning requirements

Factors affecting write energy include:
 Memory controller design
 Write amplifier circuits
 Signal integrity techniques
 Operating frequency
 Physical transmission distance

32byte DDR5 read: 32*8*[10, 15, 20pJ] = 2560, 3840, 5120pJ
32byte DDR5 write: 32*8*[15, 20, 25pJ] = 3840, 5120, 6400pJ

Estimated DDR5 DRAM burst read/write energy for 64-byte line:
Read Energy: 8-15 picojoules (pJ)
Write Energy: 12-20 picojoules (pJ)
Factors influencing energy:

DRAM I/O driver strength
Signal integrity requirements
Termination resistances
Bus voltage
Specific DDR5 speed grade

Note: Precise values depend on specific implementation and operating conditions.
These estimates are synthesized from architectural and semiconductor technology modeling, lacking a definitive single source.


CPUs (14nm TSMC):

Typical clock frequencies: 2.5 - 3.5 GHz
Cycle times: Approximately 0.28 to 0.4 nanoseconds (ns)
Specific ranges depend on performance vs. power optimization
High-performance cores tend to be closer to 0.28 ns
Power-efficient cores tend to be closer to 0.4 ns

GPUs (14nm TSMC):

Typical clock frequencies: 1.0 - 1.8 GHz
Cycle times: Approximately 0.55 to 1.0 nanoseconds (ns)
Lower clock speeds compared to CPUs due to more complex parallel processing architectures
Emphasis on throughput rather than single-thread performance

DSPs (14nm TSMC):

Typical clock frequencies: 1.5 - 2.5 GHz
Cycle times: Approximately 0.4 to 0.66 nanoseconds (ns)
Optimized for specific signal processing tasks
Cycle times can vary based on specific DSP architecture and design goals

These figures represent typical ranges and can vary based on specific implementation,
target application, and design optimization strategies. The actual cycle time is influenced
by factors like standard cell library, logic depth, clock tree design, and specific performance requirements.
