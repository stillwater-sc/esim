# Typical cycle times for CAMs in 14nm TSMC process technology generally range between 0.8 to 1.5 nanoseconds (ns).
# This range can vary depending on specific design parameters such as:
#
# Memory depth and width
# Comparison circuitry complexity
# Power consumption constraints
# Specific CAM architecture (ternary, binary)
# Peripheral circuit design
#
# The lower end of the cycle time spectrum (around 0.8-1.0 ns) is typically achieved in high-performance designs
# with optimized match line sensing and precharge circuits.
#
# More complex CAM designs with additional matching flexibility might experience slightly longer
# cycle times closer to 1.5 ns.

# It's important to note that these figures are based on typical design practices and actual implementation
# can vary. For the most precise current specifications, I recommend consulting TSMC's official technology
# documentation or conducting specific characterization studies.
#
# In the cycle time range I previously mentioned (0.8 to 1.5 ns for 14nm TSMC), typical CAM sizes would be
# in the range of 1K to 16K bits. More specifically:
#
# Small CAMs: 1K-4K bits
# Medium CAMs: 8K-16K bits
# Large CAMs: 32K-64K bits
#
# The cycle times I quoted are most representative of medium-sized CAMs in the 8K to 16K bit range.
# These sizes are commonly used in applications like:
#
# Content routing in network switches
# Cache tag matching
# Address translation buffers
# Pattern matching in network processors
# Small to medium-scale associative memory lookup engines
#
# The exact size impacts cycle time through several mechanisms:
#
# Increased bit lines and word lines
# More complex match line sensing
# Additional parasitic capacitance
# Increased match logic complexity
#
# For precise cycle time and size correlations, simulation and characterization of the specific design
# would be necessary, as the relationship isn't strictly linear and depends on detailed circuit implementation.
