# Shmoo 

This scripts directory contains shmoo sweeps of energy estimates across different dimensions.

Fundamentally, the energysim combines an operator with an execution model to model the 
energy consumption of the combination. These combinations can then be shmoo'ed across 
different dimensions, such as, algorithm/data structure size.

Metrics of interest are:

- energy per operator as a function of algorithm size 
- operator per Watt
